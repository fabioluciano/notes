# How DevOps teams are using—and abusing—DORA metrics

> as a way to measure software development.

> used for the wrong reasons, resulting in poor outcomes

> DORA stands for DevOps Research and Assessment

> collected and summarized the outcomes

> also discussed the behaviors and culture that successful organizations use and provide guidance on what to measure and why

> four key outcomes where high-performing

> Deploy frequency
Lead time
Change fail percentage
Mean time to repair

> DORA metrics became the indicator for how those efforts were progressing

>  a double-edged sword

> Metrics seem very simple, so the attitude is “Let’s measure this and display the data and we’ll know everything.” 

> when applied to anything involving people, the DORA metrics are complex and require constant vigilance and adjustment to prevent adverse side effects

> metrics is misunderstood, serious issues can occur

> seeing DORA metrics used as goals, complete with OKRs (objectives and key results) where the objective is “improve DORA metrics.” 

> Goodhart&#39;s Law states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

> High-performing organizations did not become high performing from focusing on metric goals

> focusing on the customer and how to more efficiently, effectively, and sustainably deliver value

> metrics are the outcome

> the idea of using DORA metrics to compare delivery performance between teams
