# Remembering what you Read: Zettelkasten vs P.A.R.A.

> Farnam Street’s tips on remembering what you read. Their concept of writing your notes on the book itself was liberating

> FS also suggested writing down the book’s core ideas from memory right after you finish the book

> the Zettelkasten note taking method. Its core idea is to create atomic notes, where each note is about exactly one topic (not more than a few paragraphs tops) and nothing more. Then you file the away in your system by linking that note to other notes which seem most relevant to it. 

> The key here is that the linking process groups relevant notes together. Now when you’re interested in browsing your notes on a given topic, you’ll easily find them

> With P.A.R.A. you organize all your notes by purpose, not by category.
