# What Is an API?

> The abbreviation, API, stands for application programming interface

> program how that software can interact with other software

> where applications or clearly defined layers of software talk to each other

> APIs are the directions for interaction between different types of software

> In this example, the kitchen is one application that makes things, the customer is an application that needs things, the menu is the list of API calls you can make, and the waiter is the programming interface that communicates the order of things back and forth between the two.

> A public API is available to everyone for use

> partner API is publicly promoted but only shared with business partners who have signed an agreement with the API publisher. 

> A private API is only for use by developers working within a single organization
