# Introduction to GraphQL

> GraphQL is a language designed for client applications to fetch the exact data needed from an API.

> GraphQL allows client applications to describe the type and shape of data required from a backend API.

> GraphQL enables client applications to call a single endpoint for any type of request.

> GraphQL is like SQL, but for the front end.
